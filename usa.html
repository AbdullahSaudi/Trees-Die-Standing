        <h3>USA:</h3>

        <p>
            In western North America, dwarf mistletoes are generally considered the most damaging type of forest disease. There are areas where root diseases are more important, but mistletoes are important in many forest types, on most major tree species, over vast areas. Important forms of damage include: <br><br>
            1.  Growth loss<br><br>
            2.	Mortality<br><br> 
            3.	Predisposition to other mortality agents (e.g., bark beetles) and decay fungi (after old stem infections become cankerous)<br><br>
            4.	Dead tops<br><br>
            5.	Defect (stem swellings, cankers, other deformities)<br><br>
            6.	Reduced production and viability of seed <br><br>
        </p>

        <p>
            Dwarf mistletoes increase host mortality, the effect becoming larger as infection severity increases. Certain dwarf mistletoes are considered to be especially lethal.
        </p>

        <p>
            Mortality can be strongly influenced by water relations. It is greater on dry than on wet sites  and also during or following a drought. Large trees survive longer than small trees, but even large, mature Pinus ponderosa can be killed by dwarf mistletoe.
        </p>

        <p>
            In P. contorta stands infested for 80 years, 15% of the standing basal area was killed by dwarf mistletoe (determined by subtracting standing mortality in similar but uninfected stands . However, most of the snags in that study were quite small.
        </p>

        <p>
            Dwarf mistletoes frequently increase susceptibility to attack by bark beetles. In Colorado, dwarf mistletoe increases susceptibility of P. Ponderosa to mountain pine beetle (MPB) and western pine beetle.
        </p>

        <p>
            In the case of Pseudotsuga menziesii, dwarf mistletoe may have little effect on bark beetle susceptibility. However, such predisposition has been suggested for northern Idaho. <br><br>
        </p>

        <h4>ECONOMIC IMPACTS OF MISTLETOE IN USA:</h4>
        <p>It has been estimated that, in western USA, dwarf mistletoes cause direct, annual wood volume loss of 11.8 million m3. This is roughly equivalent to 3.3 billion board feet. This estimate includes only commercial forest land on National Forests, and it doesn’t include defect and loss of wood quality. There is a great deal more dwarf mistletoe in non-timber lands and in other ownerships. That said, most losses are not realized, i.e., based on current management, much of it likely wouldn’t have been harvested even if healthy. In western Canada, a comparable loss estimate is 3.8 million m3 yr.</p>
