        <h3>EUROPE:</h3>

        <p>
            The hemiparasitic European mistletoe (Viscum album) from the family Viscaceae (Santalaceae s.l.) is able to infest more than 380 woody taxa in Europe.
        </p>

        <p>
            At the beginning of the 20th century, less than 10 % of Hungary was infested. The distribution area was centralized in the Transdanubian Mountains, and no mass occurrence was noticed elsewhere. Since then, the infested area has almost tripled, and heavily infested forests can be observed in numerous parts of Hungary, especially in the northeast area of the Hungarian Great Plain. However, the central region of the Hungarian Great Plain is still uninfested.
        </p>

        <p>
            In the North Hungarian Mountains, where the presence of potential hosts is very frequent, mistletoe is still quite rare. The most infested macroregion of Hungary is Western Transdanubia, the only region where all three different subspecies can be found.
        </p>

        <p>
            The increased mistletoe occurrence can be attributed to several factors, including human impact, larger forest area and a growing number of breeding pairs of the mistle thrush (Turdus viscivorus).
        </p>

        <p>
            No significant changes have been observed in the proportions of the most common hosts in the last 90 years, with poplars (Populus spp.) and black locust (Robinia pseudoacacia) still being the most frequently infested species. Silver maple (Acer saccharinum) is now a heavily infested host in city parks, while the abundance of infested apple (Malus spp.) and pear (Pyrus spp.) trees has decreased with the transformation of cultivation techniques.
        </p>

        <p>
            Scots pine (Pinus sylvestris L.) is the main host tree of pine mistletoe (Viscum album L. ssp. austriacum (Wiesb.) Vollm.) in Central Europe.
        </p>

        <p>
            In south-west Germany, the total area infested by the pine mistletoe is currently ~6500 ha (as estimated by the forest administration) and has increased in recent years
        </p>

        <p>
            Mistletoe was found on 12 forest tree species, most frequently on silver fir and Scots pine, much less often on birches and deciduous admixture species. Common beech, pedunculate, and sessile oaks, as well as coniferous admixture species, were found to be free from the parasite. Mistletoe was more common on larger trees, mainly those in the 1st and 2nd Kraft classes, characterized by a higher DBH value than trees without V. album. Infestation was also age-dependent with low numbers of infested trees in young age classes and a much higher proportion of infested trees being over 80â€“100 years in age.
        </p>

        <p>
            Viscum album was recently reported by ICP Forests as an important causal agent of biotic damage to Scots and Austrian pines in Europe.  Similar concerns were expressed by regional reports from the Rhone valley in Switzerland, Brandenburg in Germany, Hungary, and Poland. There are also publications on the occurrence of mistletoe on silver fir in France, Switzerland, Croatia, Romania, Spain, and Greece.
